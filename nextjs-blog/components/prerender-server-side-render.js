// If a page uses Server-side Rendering, the page HTML 
// is generated on each request.

//Also referred to as "SSR" or "Dynamic Rendering".

// To use Server-side Rendering for a page, you need 
// to export an async function called getServerSideProps. 
// This function will be called by the server on every request.
